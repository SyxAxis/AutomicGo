# AutomicGo

Using Golang with the Automic Automation REST API - WIP

I've worked with Automic ( formally UC4 ) for many years, usually coded with the very comprehensive Java API but this is an excuse to spend time with Go and REST with an app I actually know and have reasons to do things.

Very much a basic POC and WIP just to play with some ideas.

The reason you won't find anything to update objects it that Automic expects you to dump the JSON, edit and resubmit. Neat but means the owness is on you to do all the heavy lifting with features, until the previous Java API.
